# Coyan: A Static Fault Tree Unreliability solver using Weighted Model Counting

Coyan is a tool that internally translates a Fault Tree in GALILEO format to CNF formula, and if a WMC solver is provided,
runs the solver obtaining the Unreliability of the Fault Tree.

## Build

Create the binary `/target/release/coyan_fta` by running:

```bash
cargo build --release -p coyan_fta
```

## Usage

```bash
./target/release/coyan_fta <COMMAND> -i <INPUT> [OPTIONS] 
```

Commands:

- `info`: Outputs information about the FT, like the amount of basic events, of gates and the number of clauses generated by the method.
  - OPTIONS:
    - `--simplify`: Simplify the FT by removing gates with only one child.
    - `-h, --help`: Print help

- `translate`: Translates the FT implicit formula to a CNF equisatisfiable formula. Outputs a DIMACS file with a wcnf.
  - OPTIONS:
    - `-o, --output <OUTPUT>`: Output file, writes .cnf or .wcnf depending on the format.
    - `-t, --timebounds <TIMEBOUNDS> <TIMEBOUNDS> <TIMEBOUNDS>`: Time bounds for the exponential models. It creates a range of values according to the command arguments: `[start, end, step]`. Conflicts with `timepoint`.
    - `--timepoint <TIMEPOINT>`: Compute Unreliability of the FT a given time point [default: 1]. Conflicts with `timebounds`.
    - `--format <FORMAT>`: Output format for the CNF formula. The format gives the extension to the file. Support values `MC21` and `MCC` [default: `MC21`]
    - `--simplify`: Simplify the FT by removing gates with only one child.
    - `--verb`: Verbosity, if true, prints more details at finish. Default = false.
    - `-h, --help`: Print help

- `solve`: Executes a Solver to obtain the TEP of the FT at a given time point or time bounds.
  - Supported Solvers: `GPMC` and `ADDMC`.
  - OPTIONS:
    - `-s, --solver-path <SOLVER_PATH>`: Solver path and arguments. If the solver needs arguments, separate them using a colon. Example: `/solvers/gpmc:mode=1`
    - `-t, --timebounds <TIMEBOUNDS> <TIMEBOUNDS> <TIMEBOUNDS>`: Time bounds for the exponential models. It creates a range of values according to the command arguments: `[start, end, step]`. Conflicts with `timepoint`.
    - `--timepoint <TIMEPOINT>`: Compute Unreliability of the FT a given time point [default: 1]. Conflicts with `timebounds`.
    - `--timeout-s <TIMEOUT_S>`: Execution timeout for the WMC solver in seconds. [Default: 300 (5 minutes)]
    - `--format <FORMAT>`: Output format for the CNF formula. Support values `MC21` and `MCC` [default: `MC21`]
    - `--num_threads  <NUM_THREADS>`: Number of threads to use when time bounds are used [default: 4].
    - `--simplify`: Simplify the FT by removing gates with only one child.
    - `--verb`: Verbosity, if true, prints more details when finished. [Default: false]
    - `-h, --help`: Print help
